# Stock Watchlist

This is a simple watch list PyQt GUI. Originaly intended it to pull data from the internet and populate a list and the user could put the stocks of interest on the list, but the idea of a desktop GUI was scrapped for a web application. The project was a good experience learning to use PyQT to make an application.  

# Usage:
Clone the repository and issue command: "pyhton watchlist.py gui" and the GUI will appear.

Use the + and - buttons to add/remove a list item. Use the up and down arrows to move the item up and down the list relative to others. The save button will save your stock list for the enxt time you open on in a sqlite database.  The arrows under the save button will load a database.
